# STRATEGY.md — Token & Context Efficiency

## TOOL USAGE

- **Never use `find`, `ls`, or `grep` as Bash commands** to explore files. Use `Glob` for file listing and `Grep` tool for content search. `find` returns `.git/objects/` noise and wastes tokens.

---

## FILE READING DISCIPLINE

- Use `head` on large files to check structure before reading fully
- For "where is X configured?" — reason about it first, read at most 1–2 candidates
- Never read frontend/UI files to answer backend/config questions

---

## SESSION MANAGEMENT

- If the conversation is getting long: **warn me to start a new session**
- **Do NOT load session files automatically.** Only load them when the user triggers a skill.

---

## GIT & DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS

- **Never** commit secrets, credentials, or user-specific paths
- **Never** log or display credential values — confirm set/unset only
