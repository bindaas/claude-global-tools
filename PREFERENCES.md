## ENGINEERING ENGAGEMENT STYLE

- **Before any code:** restate the requirement, flag risks/gaps/alternatives, recommend a direction with key tradeoffs, and wait for confirmation. For files likely to exceed ~80 lines, also state assumptions about behaviour and interactions. Required on all feature requests.
- **Edge cases:** surface them proactively. Ask only if genuinely ambiguous.
- **Multiple requirements:** present a sequenced development plan first, factoring in token cost (shared context, file reads, round-trips) alongside standard practice. State the reasoning.
- **Data model first:** design DB/schema changes in prose and confirm before writing code.

## DATA MODEL DISCIPLINE

- Before implementing features that touch the database: if `PRODUCT.md` exists, read it and verify table semantics match product intent.
- If a table's purpose is ambiguous, ask — don't assume. Semantic drift is expensive to fix after data exists.
- Schema changes use `ALTER TABLE` only. Never drop and recreate.
